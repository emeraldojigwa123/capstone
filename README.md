## About The Project 
 My name is EMERALD OJIGWA IJEOMA and since this website is a portfolio website its header has the name **Emerald**.

 **Home** 
I made my Homepage brief as it contains just a welcome message and the footer.

 **About** 
This page talks about me and also about my work and how I go about it in as much ways as i possibly can. It also contains some things about me i felt where unnecessary at some point, but i still added it anyways :sweat_smile:

 **Services** 
This page talks more in lists about what I can offer in terms of web designing and the importance of this services as some of them help your website to be more recognizable and functional.

 **Portfolio** 
 This page showcases the projects I've worked on. It might not look sophisticated but I put effort in it, and I'm still improving :innocent:

 **Contact** 
 This is a page that contains my contact informations as well as icons linked to their respective social media handles. it also has my location, Phone number and e-mail address.

  *footer*
  This has my name, the Cohort I'm in under HerTechTrail. And the link takes you to hertechtrail website

  *header*
  contains the site name and logo. Because I am named after a precious stone, I decided it would be fit to use an emerald stone as my logo :upside_down_face:

  ## Getting Started
  You may start your codes from scratch, or you could get a free template online. After downloading a prefered website template, you could edit the codes to your taste as well as change the colours and so on.

  ## Journey and Challenges
  I was able to achieve my website with a given template and carefully edited it to suit my desire. While doing this one needs to be extra careful, as any mistake could ruin the entire codes or lead you to confusion :joy:
  <br>
  I faced some difficulties during this journey as my about us page kept proving stubborn but I finally had a grip on it. The nav refused to open while on the about us page but look i fixed it <br>*https://capstone-ashen-sigma.vercel.app/about.html*
