 **Home** 
I made my Homepage brief as it contains just a welcome message and the footer.

This page talks about me and also about my work and how I go about it in as much ways as i possibly can. It also contains some things about me i felt where unnecessary at some point, but i still added it anyways :sweat_smile:

 **Services** 
This page talks more in lists about what I can offer in terms of web designing and the importance of this services as some of them help your website to be more recognizable and functional.

 **Portfolio** 
 This page showcases the projects I've worked on. It might not look sophisticated but I put effort in it, and I'm still improving :innocent:

 **Contact** 
 This is a page that contains my contact informations as well as icons linked to their respective social media handles. it also has my location, Phone number and e-mail address.

  *footer*
  This has my name, the Cohort I'm in under HerTechTrail. And the link takes you to hertechtrail website

  *header*
  contains the site name and logo. Because I am named after a precious stone, I decided it would be fit to use an emerald stone as my logo :upside_down_face:
